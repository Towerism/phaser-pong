# Phaser Pong

> A simple pong game implemented in Typescript using the Phaser framework.

This was adapted based off this [tutorial](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@onepice/making-ping-pong-game-with-phaser-3-part-2). Parcel is used as a bundler in order to use typescript, and a different project structure was used because the intent is to refactor so that the game logic is split up into several different components rather than it all being in the PlayScene.
